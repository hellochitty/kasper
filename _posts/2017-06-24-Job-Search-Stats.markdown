I started my job search with no idea how it would turn out. All I hoped for was to get an offer with a company I was excited to work at with great opportunities to flex my coding muscles. I aimed for one offer and got five in two weeks.

Things to note:
* My sample sizes are very low. I didn't intend on the search ending so quickly, and thus I don't have a ton of data to work with.
* Job search strategies need to vary person by person. What works for me might not work for you.
* I collected 2 types of data: application stats, and time spent on various job app activities (I tracked my time using Toggl)
* Unless specified, the stats do not show which opportunities I did not pursue. For example, if I got a coding challenge, and did not do it, I did not include it.

Findings:
* Volume is important. Most places I applied to never responded.
